Test cases
F(x)
1. x^2-7x+10
2. 2x^3-13x^2+22x-8
3. 8x^3-1

f_x
1. [1,-7,10]
2. [2,-13,22,-8]
3. [8,0,0,-1]

a_0, b_0
1. 4,1
2. -1,1.5
3. -1,3

zero_f
1. 2
2. 0.5
3. 0.5

Values for a_0, b_0 are such that f(a_0) < 0, and f(b_0) > 0.
Rather than the exact value of zero_f, the function returns a highly accurate, but approximate value.
This is because despite always being very close, the program would keep running to find f(m_i) = 0 exactly.
To avoid this issue, the loop terminates when f(m) is approximately equal to 0 within a miniscule error value.
